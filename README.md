# Post Office Application

This small web app retrieves information about the user based on their IP address and displays:

- The client's IP address
- Location on an embedded map (Google Maps iframe) with a marker
- Current local time in the user's timezone
- A list of local post offices for the user's postal pincode

This project uses the Geoapify API key provided in the code to render a static map fallback.
